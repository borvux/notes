### Slide 1: Why Rails?

"Good morning, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about Ruby on Rails. Specifically, we'll be answering the question: 'Why Rails?' Why is this framework a great choice for building web applications?"

### Slide 2: Ancestry

"To understand why Rails is so powerful, let's start with an analogy from biology. Human and chimpanzee DNA is about 98% the same. A very small fraction of our DNA is what makes us distinct. We share so much DNA because we have a common ancestor from millions of years ago."

### Slide 3: Ancestry

"Believe it or not, the same principle applies to web applications. Major sites like **X** (formerly Twitter), **Shopify**, **GitHub**, and **Airbnb** share a significant portion of their core code. Most software-as-a-service applications have the same fundamental components: a web server, database connection, HTML rendering, and so on. It's only a small part of their code that makes them unique."

### Slide 4: (Rails Logos)

"And the common ancestor for many of these successful companies is Ruby on Rails."

### Slide 5: History

"Let's take a brief look at the history of Rails. In 2003, a company called 37signals (now Basecamp) hired a developer named David Heinemeier Hansson, or DHH, to build a project management tool. DHH chose to use a programming language called Ruby, which was relatively obscure at the time. He was drawn to its elegant, readable syntax, which was designed to make developers happy and productive."

### Slide 6: History

"As DHH was building Basecamp, he extracted the common, reusable parts of the application and released them to the world as a free and open-source framework called Ruby on Rails. This was a revolutionary moment for web development."

### Slide 7: Our Hack

"So, what does this mean for us? It means we get to 'hack' the system. We're using code that has been built and refined by DHH and thousands of other contributors over nearly two decades. This allows us to stand on the shoulders of giants and avoid reinventing the wheel."

### Slide 8: Why Rails?

"So, why should you learn Ruby on Rails? There are many reasons, but here are a few key ones:

* **Optimized for Programmer Happiness:** The framework is designed to be enjoyable and intuitive to work with.
* **Convention over Configuration:** Rails makes assumptions about the best way to do things, which reduces the number of decisions you have to make.
* **Integrated System:** It's a full-stack framework, meaning it handles everything from the database to the front-end.
* **One-Person Framework:** Rails empowers a single developer to build and deploy a complete application.
* **And much more:** As we'll see, Rails has a strong community, a mature ecosystem, and an elegant design."

### Slide 9: Play the whole game

"One of the most important aspects of learning to code is what we call 'playing the whole game.' To be an effective developer, you need to understand the entire process of building and deploying an application. This is what we call being a 'full-stack' developer. Many courses teach skills in isolation, but we believe that building a real, working application is the most motivating and effective way to learn."

### Slide 10: Play the whole game

"In the world of web development, we often refer to these full-stack applications as 'monoliths.' Rails is a perfect example of a monolithic framework. It provides all the tools you need to handle everything from front-end JavaScript to back-end database migrations, all in one integrated package.

Now, it’s important to note that in this introductory course, we will be focusing on the foundational concepts of web development and will not be using Rails directly. However, the skills you learn here will provide a strong foundation for the next course in our program, where you will dive deep into building applications with Ruby on Rails."

### Slide 11: (T-Shaped Skills)

"This 'full-stack' approach helps you develop what are known as 'T-shaped skills.' You'll gain a broad understanding of the entire software development lifecycle, while also having the opportunity to develop deep expertise in specific areas that you find interesting and marketable."

### Slide 12: Convention over configuration

"Let's talk more about 'Convention over Configuration.' This is a core principle of Rails. By providing sensible defaults and conventions, Rails reduces the number of trivial decisions you have to make. This frees up your mental energy to focus on what really matters: solving your users' problems."

### Slide 13: Convention over configuration

"A simple example is database primary keys. You could name your primary key column 'id', 'postId', 'posts_id', or something else. As long as you're consistent, it doesn't really matter. Rails makes this decision for you by convention, so you don't have to think about it."

### Slide 14: Convention over configuration

"Here’s a more concrete example from what we've learned about routing. If you follow Rails' naming conventions, you can write a lot less code. In this example, you don't need to explicitly tell Rails to render the `home.html.erb` template. It automatically looks for a template in `views/pages/` that matches the controller action name, which in this case is `home`."

### Slide 15: One Person Framework

"DHH has called Rails 'The One-Person Framework' because it makes it possible for a single developer to create, deploy, and maintain a sophisticated web application. This is more relevant than ever. As Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, has said, 'AI will make it possible for one person to build a billion-dollar company very soon.' Frameworks like Rails are the perfect tool to leverage that power."

### Slide 16: Programmer Happiness

"Another core tenet of Ruby and Rails is 'Programmer Happiness,' which is closely related to the 'Principle of Least Surprise.' Things should work the way you expect them to. For example, if you're in the interactive Ruby console and you want to exit, you can type either `exit` or `quit`. Ruby understands what you mean. Python, on the other hand, will give you an error message if you type `exit` instead of `exit()`."

### Slide 17: Programmer Happiness

"Ruby is also known for its clear and helpful error messages. Instead of just telling you that something is wrong, it will often give you a hint about how to fix it. In this example, the error message not only tells us that the `sign` method is undefined, but it also suggests that we might have meant `sing`. Always remember to read the error messages!"

### Slide 18: Java

"To appreciate the conciseness of Ruby, let's look at a simple 'Hello, World!' program in Java. You have to create a class, a `main` method, and then use a verbose command to print a line of text. And to run it, you need to compile it first, and then execute the compiled code."

### Slide 19: Ruby

"Now, here's the same 'Hello, World!' program in Ruby. It's just one line. And to run it, you just execute the file directly. This simplicity is a hallmark of Ruby's design."

### Slide 20: Rails Doctrine

"Many of the ideas we've discussed are part of what's known as the 'Rails Doctrine.' This is a set of principles that guide the development of the framework. I highly recommend reading it to get a deeper understanding of the philosophy behind Rails."

### Slide 21: Setup for Career Success

"So, to summarize, learning Rails is a great way to set yourself up for career success. It reduces the friction of getting started, allows you to 'play the whole game' of web development, and helps you develop a taste and feel for what it's like to build real-world applications."

### Slide 22: Questions?

"And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have."

### Slide 23: References

"Finally, here are some resources if you'd like to learn more about the history and philosophy of Ruby on Rails."
