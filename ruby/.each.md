# Lesson: Iterating with Ruby's `.each` Method
- In Ruby, most of our work involves managing lists—photos, messages, records, etc. The Array class is our go-to data structure for these lists, and looping over an array is one of the most common tasks. While you could use Integer’s `.times` method to iterate over an array (by counting its length), Ruby offers a more elegant solution with the Array’s `.each` method.

### examples of `Array`
```ruby
a = []

a = Array.new

a = "ruby".split("")

a = [1, 2, 3]
```

## Iterating Over Arrays: Using `.times` vs `.each`
```ruby
# .times
words = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
number_of_words = words.count

number_of_words.times do |the_index|
  pp words.at(the_index).capitalize
  pp words.at(the_index).reverse
  pp words.at(the_index).upcase
end
```
- We count the array length and use that value with .times.
- The block variable (the_index) is an integer, used to access elements with words.at(the_index).

```ruby
# .each
words = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

words.each do |the_word|
  pp the_word.capitalize
  pp the_word.reverse
  pp the_word.upcase
end
```
### Benefits of `.each`
- Simplicity:
    - You don't need to count the array’s length.
    - Ruby takes care of iterating the correct number of times.
- Readability:
    - The block variable (in this case, `the_word`) directly represents the element.
    - Best practice: name the array plurally (e.g., `words`) and the block variable singularly (e.g., `word` or `the_word`).
- Less Error-Prone:
    - No manual indexing is required.
    - The code is cleaner and easier to understand.

## Examples
### looping through every element in array
```ruby
array = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']

array.each do |character|
  pp "#{character.upcase}"
end
```

### even word?
```ruby
list_of_words = ["zebra", "giraffe", "monkey", "salmon"]

list_of_words.each do |word|
  if word.even?
    pp word
  end
end
```

### letter count?
```ruby
word = ["photo", "like", "commenter"].sample

word.split("").each do |character|
  count = word.count(character)
  pp "#{character} appears #{count} times"
end
```

# Conclusion
The `.each` method is fundamental in Ruby for iterating over collections. It simplifies your code by eliminating manual counting and indexing, and makes your intentions clear.
